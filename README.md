# Sales Forecasting – Rossmann Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting daily sales using historical data from the Rossmann Store Sales dataset. The study compares classical time-series models with a machine learning-based approach.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Rossmann Store Sales
- File used: train.csv

## Models Implemented
- ARIMA
- Prophet
- XGBoost Regressor

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

## Key Insights
- ARIMA captures short-term trends but struggles with complex patterns.
- Prophet models seasonality more effectively.
- XGBoost outperforms classical models through feature engineering and non-linear learning.

## Conclusion
Machine learning-based forecasting demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional time-series models for sales prediction.
